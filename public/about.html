      <h3>James Moon</h3>
      <p>My name is James and I'm just stepping into coding. My limited experience would boil down to making websites in the past, but mostly using HTML. So far this has been a great learning experience with skills I'd like to see myself use in the future. Outside of this you can usually find me at a buffet. More specifically, Old Country Buffet.</p>

      <h3>Michael Mailman</h3>
      <p>This is Mike's biggest foray into web development as a web developer. Coming from a background of QA/SDET testing and automation, he hasn't had the pleasure of experiencing development from the developer perspective. He is finding that his background as an SDET has given him more of an awareness of quality that he tries to apply to code to produce higher quality code.</p>

      <h3>Peter Breen</h3>
      <p>I do front-end development in Seattle, take photos (of airplanes, mostly), and hike mountains from time to time. I used to think I wanted to be an archivist. Now I think about making usable websites.</p>

      <p>Chances are, if an airplane flies overhead, I can either identify it or look it up. It's not like I have a frequently-used app just to find out just what model, carrier, and flight it is or anything.</p>
